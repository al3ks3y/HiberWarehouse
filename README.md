# HiberWarehouse
 Warehouse management system
 
This DB-API is my test project for www.moysklad.ru/

DB is run on POSTGRES DB, Hibernate as an Entity Manager and Spark Java, responsible for server-API manipulations. Besides, Jackson JSON parser and other stuff is used.

The settings for the Postgres can be found in the Configurations File. The API is run on port 7777.

This repository also contains a POSTMAN collection for you to make it easier to test this task, dear examiner =)

The API documentation can be found here: https://hiberware.docs.apiary.io/#

Easter eggs inside. Take care.
